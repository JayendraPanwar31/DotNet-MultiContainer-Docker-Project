# DotNet-MultiContainer-Docker-Project
Creating this project to learn docker multi container.
What we need to do:
1. Create 2 microservices.
2. Create database.
3. Connection between 2 microservices.
4. One service will get data from another service.
5. Create Dockerfile.
6. Build and push Docker images to DockerHub first for each service.
7. Then we will use docker compose to manage multi containers.
8. Once these are done we will start learning Kubernetes.
